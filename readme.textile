h1. Auto debugger

Don't quite know where I am going with this yet. But here is what I am thinking...

* I need a tool which can record a trace of all the lines executed in a python program along with any relevant state at that point of time.

* The relevant state should probably be captured as deltas.

* I should be able to see the values passed to a function along with the names of the arguments.

* I should be able to see the value returned by a logged function.
